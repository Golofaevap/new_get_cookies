*✨How did Africa Bloggers Forum come about ?*
There’s a Problem in FUTO, not just FUTO, but in most Nigerian Universities. 

The students are highly focused educationally, but skill-wise and talent-wise, are highly lagging behind. 

Africa Bloggers Forum is here to bridge this gap and bring balance to the system, as the skills and talents of every Nigerian student is brought to fore, creating wealth for them as we leverage on blogging.

✨VISION:
*To become The VOICE OF ARFICA.*

I mean both online and offline our voices in every niche can be heard. 

AFRICA BLOGGERS FORUM (AFB) is a movement out of Africa to the world. You either join us to sail this ark or you paddle in a boat. 

✨MISSION:
1. *To become the voice for every Nigerian/African Student within and outside the campus by promoting/advertising their skills and talents*.

2. *To raise a community of highly trained bloggers whose automated business (blogs/website) generate residual income daily*.
